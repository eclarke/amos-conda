1. Code 

1.1 AMOS pipelines

* subAMOS.amos
Pipeline for extracting a subset of scaffolds/contigs & all related information (unitigs, reads, mate pairing) from an AMOS .afg file

* subCA.amos
Pipeline for extracting a subset of scaffolds/contigs & all related information (unitigs, reads, mate pairing) from a CA .frg & .asm file

1.2 Perl scripts 

* AMOS2info.pl
Program that parses an AMOS message file (.afg) and prints out the following information in a TAB delimited format:
  1. type
  2. internal identifier
  3. external identifier
  4. offset from the beginning of the file
  5. length

Missing identifiers are replaced with "." (to keep the number of columns==5)

* AMOS2map.pl
Program that parses an AMOS message file (.afg) and prints out related message information in a TAB delimited format:
  1. type  (parent)
  2. internal identifier
  3. external identifier

  4. type  (child)
  5. internal identifier
  6. external identifier

Missing identifiers are replaced with "." (to keep the number of columns==6)

* CA2info.pl
Program that parses a CA message file (.frg or .asm) and prints out the following information in a TAB delimited format:
  1. message type
  2. internal identifier
  3. external identifier
  4. offset from the beginning of the file
  5. length

Missing identifiers are replaced with "." (to keep the number of columns==5)

* CA2map.pl
Program that parses a CA message file (.frg or .asm) and prints out related message information in a TAB delimited format:
  1. type  (parent)
  2. internal identifier
  3. external identifier

  4. type  (child)
  5. internal identifier
  6. external identifier

Missing identifiers are replaced with "." (to keep the number of columns==6)

* intersect1.pl
Program that filters records from one file based on record information from a second file

* intersect2.pl
Program that identifies and prints out related records from two files

* newAMOSiids.pl
Program that parses an AMOS message file and resassigns internal ids to scaffolds and contigs

* subMsg.pl
Program that filters a message file (CA,AMOS) based on the message ids

2. Usage

2.1 subAMOS.amos

* Create AMOS file that contains all the assembly components (SCF, CTG, RED, FRG, LIB ...)
    bank-report -b prefix.bnk/ > prefix.afg

* Create filter file
	Format: 
		MSG_TYPE	IID	EID
	Example
		CTG		1	contig_1
		CTG		2	.
		CTG		.	contig_3

* Run pipeline
	subAMOS.amos prefix
