<h1><a name="launchpad"></a>Launch Pad</h1>

<p>
The Launch Pad is the first window displayed in Hawkeye 
and acts as an overview and portal to your assembly. Its
tabbed interface displays high level statistics, feature,
library, scaffold, contig, and read information. The Launch
Pad is interactive, so that you can select a feature, scaffold,
contig, or read, and the display will focus on that object. At the
very top is a Menu Bar, followed by a row of controls. The Contig ID
Spin Box allows you to jump to a particular contig, and see the
currently active contig. The "All Views" button displays both the 
<a href="scaffold.html#scaffold">Scaffold</a> and 
<a href="contig.html#contig">Contig</a>
views while the "Scaffold View" and "Contig View" buttons display
just that view respectively. Below that is a tabbed display showing
different aspects of your assembly, as explained below.

<a name="lp-statistics"></a><h3>Statistics</h3>
<p>The initial
display shows high level statistics. The left side table
has common assembly size statistics explained such as average
and N50 scaffold and contig sizes. An explaination of these
metrics is provided <a href="http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/research/castats.shtml">here</a>.
To the right of this table is a graphical display of the scaffolds (top)
and contigs (bottom). The size of the rectangles indicates the size of
objects. The color of the rectangle indicates the number of features
found in that scaffold or contig (red=high count, green=low count). 
You can mouse over any rectangle to view its id, size, and feature count, 
or double click on a rectangle to open separate 
<a href="scaffold.html#scaffold">Scaffold</a> and
<a href="contig.html#contig">Contig</a> displays. 
The barchart can also be sorted
by feature count, so that contigs will be ranked by their likelihood
of misassembly, or as a spacefiling treemap to better utilize the space
available. Below we can see visually there are 3 large scaffolds 
which account for most of the bases in the assembly.

<a href="#top">Return to top</a><br><hr>
<a name="lp-features"></a><h3>Features</h3>
<p>
The next tab is labeled "Features" and displays a table of the features
in your assembly. AMOS comes bundled with tools for creating several types
of features for mis-assembly detection, such as high occurence of compressed
or expanded mates, regions of correlated SNPs, or read alignment breakpoint
positions. The feature tab allows you to see which contigs have a high
number of features, and a report on what type of features are present. Double
Clicking on a feature displays that region in the scaffold and
contig windows if they are open. If they are not open, click the
"All views", "Scaffold View", or "Contig View" to display that region. A radio
button groups features by the contig they occur in, or the type of feature.
Click on the column headers to sort by that column.

<a name="lp-libraries"></a><h3>Libraries</h3>
<p>
The next tab is labeled "Libraries" and displays a table of the inserts
and libraries in your assembly. The Mean and Standard Deviations columns
reflect the sizes specified by the input files, the Inserts column is the
number of inserts in the entire bank. Select an insert by clicking on its
row. Then Click one of the Distribution buttons at the bottom to see a
histogram of those values. "Insert Size" is the histogram of inserts sizes
for inserts in contigs in the assembly; "Read Clear Range" is the histogram
of clear range length for all reads in the library (not necessarily in a
contig); "Read Length" is the full length of all reads in that library;
and "GC Content" is the GC Content of all reads in that library.

<a name="lp-scaffolds"></a><h3>Scaffolds</h3>
<p>
The next tab is labeled "Scaffolds" and displays a table of scaffolds in
your assembly. Click on the column headers to sort by that column. Click
the plus box to see which contigs are in that scaffold. Double clicking
on any scaffold or contig displays it in the scaffold and contig windows
if they are open. If not, click one of the view buttons to display that
scaffold or contig. At the bottom of the table are search boxes to search
for a scaffold or contig by name, and buttons to display the span of
scaffolds as a barchart as on the Statistics view, or a histogram of
contigs per scaffold.

<a name="lp-contigs"></a><h3>Contigs</h3>
<p>
The next tab is labeled "Contigs" and displays a table of contigs in
your assembly. Click on the column headers to sort by that column. At
the bottom are search boxes to search for a particular contig by name.
Next to that is a click box to also display read information for each
contig. Note this can take a long time and use a lot of memory if your
assembly has many reads (more than 100k reads). If the Display Reads
checkbox is displayed, then you can expand the plus next to each contig
to see which reads are present in each contig. Double click on a contig
or read to display it in the scaffold or contig views if they are open,
or double click and click on a View button at the top to display it.
In the bottom right are buttons to display an barchart of the contig sizes,
a histogram of reads per contig, and a plot of GC content of your reads.

<a name="lp-reads"></a><h3>Reads</h3>
<p>
The next tab is labeled "Reads" and displays a table of reads in
the current contig. Click on the column headers to sort by the column.
At the bottom are search boxes to search for a particular read by name.
Next to the search boxes are buttons to display a histograms of read length
and GC content of the reads in the current contig. Double click on a read
to jump to that read in the scaffold or contig view.
